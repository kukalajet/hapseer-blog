We live in uncertain times. There are contradictory predictions on a daily basis: from mass unemployment due to AI to the AI era being simply a bubble ready to pop in a dot-com fashion. Separating real signals from noise has become very difficult. On the one hand, there are companies freezing new hiring (or even laying off staff) on the basis that AI may do the job better, cheaper, and faster. _On the other hand, [leading AI labs have started outsourcing to cheaper markets](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/openai-launch-first-india-office-new-delhi-this-year-2025-08-22/) to lower engineering costs when you would expect them to be the first to replace software engineers for good._

Keeping up with useful information in the last three years has, at times, been impossible. Less than 15 years ago, the whole idea of using neural networks to solve real-world problems sounded silly. We have passed from "AI winters" to an era of AI proliferation. Artificial Intelligence has become mainstream. Everyone uses LLMs in one way or another, from the young to the old. The technology has been integrated into many products, and the promise of its capabilities is even greater.

_[Boom](https://press.stripe.com/boom)_, a book that I have been reading lately, argues that society have escaped stagnations (and risk aversion) only by inflating financial bubbles. For the authors, Bubbles that are often seen as destructive forces, have actually been crucial engines of innovation throughout history. The AI economy, at the moment, doesn't make much sense. [Immense data centers cost](https://x.com/robertwiblin/status/1951248197881393235) and a run to the bottom per token cost. It is known that everything could be a bubble, at least until it bursts. As an interested party (as a software engineer), I have been trying to look out for signals that the burst will be imminent.

Some weeks ago, during my morning coffee, I opened Instagram and [saw various major accounts posting](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNdpUFsI_Jk) about Edi Rama, the Prime Minister of Albania, saying that Albania will have an AI-run Ministry sooner than we may think. I was surprised by the virality of the news but didn't pay much attention to those posts, as they looked like engagement farming. Later, I decided to check what was happening in the world (on Twitter) and, to my surprise, Rama appeared there as well. I thought it must be the algorithm playing with me, even though none of the content was from Albanian creators, who seemed largely unconcerned. I decided to check the news again, and [even Politico had written an opinion piece about it](https://www.politico.eu/article/albania-use-ai-artificial-intelligenve-join-eu-corruption/)! At that point, I reached my conclusion: this was the signal I had been waiting for, the proof that we are deep in the bubble.

I started thinking more deeply about what this meant for me, as someone who could be involved in the discussion for at least two reasons:
1. As a tech professional who uses LLMs (or as they are commonly called, AI) on a daily basis for work and knows how they work and their limitations.
2. As an Albanian citizen.

# Welcome to MDX: Interactive Blog Posts

This is an example MDX post that demonstrates how **MDX content** is rendered using the same styling as regular Markdown posts.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. This means you can create interactive and dynamic content while maintaining the same styling as your regular blog posts.

### Key Features

- **Consistent styling**: All HTML elements are styled using your existing component mappings
- **Interactive components**: You can embed React components directly in your content
- **Frontmatter support**: Metadata parsing works exactly the same as with `.md` files
- **Seamless integration**: Both `.md` and `.mdx` files work side by side

## Code Examples

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```javascript
function greetReader(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our MDX-powered blog.`;
}

console.log(greetReader("Developer"));
```

## Lists and Quotes

Here's an unordered list:

- First item with **bold text**
- Second item with *italic text*
- Third item with [a link](https://example.com)

And an ordered list:

1. Setup MDX processing
2. Configure component mappings
3. Create interactive content
4. Deploy and enjoy!

> This is a blockquote that should be styled consistently with your existing theme. It demonstrates that all your styling is preserved when using MDX content.

## Links and Emphasis

You can still use regular [markdown links](https://mdxjs.com) and **bold text** or *italic text* just like in regular markdown.

The beauty of this setup is that your existing `rehypeReact` configuration handles all the styling automatically, whether the content comes from `.md` or `.mdx` files.
